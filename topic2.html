        <p>Who is Pudge in Dota 2?

Pudge is a grotesque, hulking butcher who revels in slaughter and carnage. He was once a man who delved too deeply into forbidden knowledge and dark practices, becoming a monstrous figure obsessed with flesh and death. His grotesque appearance is a result of his self-experimentation and unnatural rituals. He roams the battlefield searching for fresh meat, delighting in ripping his enemies apart with his hooks and cleavers.</p>

 <h2>Pudge's Story (Lore)</h2>
 Pudge began as a butcher tasked with clearing fallen soldiers from the battlefield. Surrounded by violence and decay day after day, something within him slowly changed. What was once routine work turned into a dark obsession. Over time, he grew stronger, more twisted, and strangely drawn to the chaos of death. Now, Pudge roams the world, using his massive hook to pull enemies in, thriving in battle and leaving destruction in his wake.<br>
